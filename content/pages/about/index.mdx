Hi!

I'm a computer programming enthusiast,started way back when I picked up JavaScript and node using express as my first framework later moved on to react. I like good user interfaces and animations all of this powered by robust ,efficient architectures in the back-end.
Having this as my drive to get things done my main motivation is shipping products that make humans life better and more enjoyable all this while solving problems.Technology changes and evolves that in the JavaScript world is normal keeping up with the change is what makes it fun, I've learned new technologies like react, it's mobile counterpart react native, GraphQL, docker,and micro service architectures for making applications run efficient and at a lower cost.
Recently I picked up flutter and it has proven to deliver best possible UI/UX, in record time.
All this is to pursue my ultimate goal which is ship products that not only solve humans problems but look and feel amazing while doing it. 

 When I'm not infront of computer coding I mostly enjoy playing Call of Duty and exploring new places.
