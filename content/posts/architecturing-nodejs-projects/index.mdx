This is not an introduction to Node or a tutorial in any way, it's meant to be my take on building node applications.

### Problem

If you work in the development space you'd know that the mosst boring part of starting new and exciting projects is setting everything up right
just the way you like it. So as I developer obviously I'd like to use my developoment vodoo ðŸŒ  to make some automation changes here and there.

### Proposed Solution

My approach to solve this is well of course making my very own CLI for generating all the boilerplate code needed, which will come from a boilerplate that I will setup.
I'll start with the backend first then I'll move on to the frontend spoiler alert ðŸš” is React Native.  
My requirements for this starter kit:

- Typescript is a must ðŸ’™. I love static types and all the other goodies it comes with.
- Should have a layered architecture with GraphQL(3 layers maybe).
- Modularity so that it could easily be transformed to microservices if I want to get fancy.
- I prefer No-SQL database but sure SQL databases have their use cases too.
- Robust Error Handling and Monitoring
