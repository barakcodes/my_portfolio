Hey!, If you have been doing js or even typescript for backend you might have definately heard of [Typeorm]() is what they call and Object Relation Mapper(ORM) in short
It's does what mongoose does just with a wide range of relational and non relational databases. It's an amazing tool especially if you're dealing with relational databases
like Postgressüêò.  
 It has a bunch of features and helpers all around that make it a compelling choice not to forget it has great [typescript]() support. However the compelling thing
for me was the repositories out of the box and the typescript support which is just amazing. So I ventured out to see how well it works with mongoDB my favourite overall
database when working with Node.

### Setting Thing Up

To set everything up you need a few basic thing set up:

1.  A node js project,I used Express with typescript. You're free to choose any.
2.  MongoDB instance either running locally or anywhere else

#### 1. Adding typeorm to your project

First things first we'll install the package using `yarn` you can use npm if that's you favourite. To install yarn and all it needs run the followig command:

     yarn add typeorm reflect-metadata mongodb

Here we need `mongodb` as the driver that typeorm uses to communicate with the database, `reflect-metadata` makes sure that it's well okay for us to use the typeorm decorators
and I don't know if you saw this coming but we need `typeorm` too because we're working with well typeorm.

#### 2. setting up a database connection

After all the packages are intalled next we move to setting up a connection with our database. Typeorm has this special file called `ormconfig.json` that you create for
holding all the information that typeorm uses including the database connection parameters. You can also ignore these and just go ahead and pass the connection parameters
straight to the function that will work too.  
 We'll create a file in our project for connecting with the database I named mine`createDBConnection.ts` you can name yours whatever you want.
In the file we'll just add the following code.

```ts
import { createConnection, Connection } from "typeorm";
export const startDatabaseConnection = async (): Promise<Connection> => {
  const dbConnection: Connection = await createConnection({
    type: "mongodb",
    host: "localhost",
    port: 27017,
    database: "mongodb://localhost/test_database"
  });

  return dbConnection;
};
```

We import the function that creates the connection from typeorm the we pass it all our parameters it needs to connect to the database, and we import the connection so
we can get fancy and add types to our function declaration. Now just import this to your entry file maybe `index.ts` or something then everything should work. An you should
be connected to your database. So our setting up is done let's get our hands dirty.

### Basic operations with typeorm

So now that we're set up it's time to start digging around and see what extactly makes typeorm so special:

#### 1. Defining entities using typeorm.

Typeorm is decorator heavy and setting up entities is a little bit different than what we're used to with mongoose. So I'll just define a simple user entity in the file
`User.entity.ts`

```ts
import {
  Entity,
  ObjectID,
  ObjectIdColumn,
  Column,
  BeforeInsert
} from "typeorm";
import { hash } from "bcrypt";

@Entity()
export class User {
  @ObjectIdColumn()
  id: ObjectID;

  @Column()
  userName: string;

  @Column()
  email: string;

  @Column()
  password: string;

  @BeforeInsert()
  async hashPasswordBeforeInsert() {
    this.password = await hash(this.password, 15);
  }
}
```

I know you're looking at me now like what? I'm sorry they're not extactly similar there's just a tiny difference as you can see. Remember when I said something abou decorators,
we'll here they are. You define an entity by using the `Entity` decorator. Here we use columns for defining the collections variables. Notice the first one though we use
`@ObjectIdColumn` this is so that typeorm knows to generate the id's which we're all used to in mongoDB.  
Also you could do a lot of other nifty things before you "insert" which is just "save". As an example here I'm hashing the user's password before resetting it.
You could do a lot of other stuff with this.It's very powerfull stuff and more intuitive than good ol mongoose.  
Iorder to use mongoose life syntax like `User.find({})` you'll have to extend the class with something called `Base Entity` like so:

```ts
import {
  Entity,
  ObjectID,
  ObjectIdColumn,
  Column,
  BeforeInsert,
  BaseEntity
} from "typeorm";
export class User extends BaseEntity{

```

So I think we're good so far on the creation of entities so far. For more information just visit the [docs]().
