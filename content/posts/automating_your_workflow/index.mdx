### Problem

If you work in the development space you'd know that the mosst boring part of starting new and exciting projects is setting everything up right
just the way you like it. So as I developer obviously I'd like to use my developoment vodoo ðŸŒ  to make some automation changes here and there.
My workflow includes react,Express, GraphQL,React Native and Flutter.(Yeah I got issues I use both react native and flutter).  
 Taking all of this into account I need a workflow that covers all of this plus my git workflow. I could throw in deployment too,but that's too much for one. We take
a step at a time.

### Proposed Solution

For my first step, I thought I'd go with my backend API server boilerplate first. After some googling and github research on the current available starter boilerplates
none of them quite fit my liking so I just copy pasted the best parts of some of the best boilerplates out there and added some of my styles and little things I wanted
and put it together. If you're intrested to read more about it you cag go [here]() and the [github repo]().
My approach to solve this is well of course making my very own CLI for generating all the boilerplate code needed, which will come from a boilerplate that I will setup.
and it will manage my git.I'll start with the backend first then I'll move on to the frontend spoiler alert ðŸš” is React Native.  
My requirements for this starter kit:

- Typescript is a must ðŸ’™. I love static types and all the other goodies it comes with.
- Should have a layered architecture with GraphQL(3 layers maybe).
- Modularity so that it could easily be transformed to microservices if I want to get fancy.
- I prefer No-SQL database but sure SQL databases have their use cases too.
- Robust Error Handling and Monitoring
